                     The Language Processing Lab is based in <a href="http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages</a> and <a href="http://bmi.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Brain and Mind Institute</a>, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
					 We are interested in language comprehension, production and learning. Members of the lab have worked on the following topics among others. 
                  </p>				  
                  <br/>
				  <ol>
				  <li>Syntactic representations in language processing</li>
				  <li>Interlocutor modelling in language comprehension and production</li>
				  <li>Language prediction during interpreting and translation</li>
				  <li>Human-computer language communication</li>
				  <li>Chinese handwriting literacy</li>
				  </ol>
